Hello! I am Mehul Damani, a final year undergraduate studying Mechanical Engineering at [NTU, Singapore][ntu]. Currently, I hold concurrent research positions at the National University of Singapore and New York University. At NUS, I am a part of the [Multi-Agent Robotic Motion Lab][marmot] advised by [Guillaume Sartoretti][guillaume] . At NYU, I am a part of the [CILVR][cilvr] cluster advised by [Lerrel Pinto][lerrel]. **My research primarily lies at the intersection of reinforcement learning and robotics**. 

### Research Interests 
I am amazed by the capabilities of the human mind and aspire to develop intelligent systems with the ability to generalize, adapt and evolve in the real world. I see my research encompassing the domains of machine learning (with a focus on reinforcement learning), vision and robotics. **My current topics of focus are - [curriculum learning][curriculum] for reinforcement learning agents, [multi-agent traffic signal control][traffic] and [multi-agent pathfinding][mapf].**   

Previously, I used to work at the interface of aerospace engineering and robotics. I was fortunate to have been involved with a number of research groups at NTU to work on cutting-edge projects such as Vertical Take-off and Landing Aircrafts (VTOL), high-altitude balloons and satellite attitude control systems. These projects sparked my initial interest in control and played a pivotal role in evolving my research interests to their current form i.e., **Reinforcement Learning (AI-based Control)**.
